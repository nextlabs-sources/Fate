/* Asynchronous download:
 * <p>Transport functions often require network communications. While
 * many network operations can be automatic, some are asynchronous.
 * That is, the transport function might launch a new process to
 * perform authentication and return to the app. Although the toolkit
 * returns to the app, the download has not been completed. The app
 * must wait until the launched process completes before continuing.
 * <p>There are three possible reactions to asynchronous situations.
 * One, the transport provider can simply do the operations necessary
 * (call this R1 for reaction 1). Two, it can return and expect the
 * application to perform the operations (call this R2). Or three, it
 * can return to let the app know there is an async issue, then require
 * the app to make the call again so that the provider can finish the
 * task (call this R3).
 * <p>A transport provider might not necessarily offer all three
 * options.
 * <p>If the app and provider "agree" to R1, the provider will
 * immediately perform the async operation. However, the provider may
 * launch this operation only and not wait for it to finish. In this
 * case, the function will return to the application with the error
 * VT_ERROR_DOWNLOAD_PENDING. This means the async operations are
 * running but have not finished yet. The current version of the
 * toolkit has no mechanism for notifying the application when the
 * async operation has completed.
 * <p>If the app and provider "agree" to R2 or R3, the transport
 * provider needs a way to indicate that an async situation is at hand.
 * It will do this by returning the error code VT_ERROR_ASYNC_DOWNLOAD.
 * This error will eventually be returned by the original toolkit call
 * (such as VtObtainPrivateKeysAndCert). This error code indicates that
 * the function did not complete, however, it can still perform its
 * task with more work. The function has suspended operations and this
 * return code is the way to tell the application of the situation.
 * <p>If R2, the transport provider must define a way to indicate what
 * the app needs to do and give it the necessary information. Any extra
 * functions to execute R2 will be defined by the transport provider
 * and are outside the scope of the toolkit.
 * <p>For R3, to complete the operation, the app must call the original
 * toolkit function again. Some apps might call the original function
 * immediately, others may want to spawn a new thread, one thread
 * calling the original toolkit function, the other thread performing
 * some other operation. As with R1, though, the provider may launch
 * this operation only and not wait for it to finish. In this case, the
 * function will return to the application with the error
 * VT_ERROR_DOWNLOAD_PENDING.
 * <p>There are, then, 5 possible returns from a download function:
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *
 *    0 - The operation completed successfully
 *    PREVIOUS - The transport provider found a previous request for
 *    the same identity, to continue anyway, call again
 *    ASYNC - The transport provider needs to perform an async
 *    operation, to launch the async operation, call again
 *    PENDING - The transport provider launched the async operation but
 *    it has not completed yet, resolution procedures to be defined
 *    VT_ERROR - Some other error happened (network connection failure,
 *    authorization failure, etc.), the data cannot be downloaded
 *
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>Current resolution technique: If the return from ObtainKeyAndCert
 * is ASYNC, call again. If the return is PENDING, wait until the async
 * operation completes and call again. Currently there is no
 * programmatic way to know when it completes (we hope to have that
 * feature in the future), but an app can generally have some way to
 * determine with user input, such as an OK button. The return from the
 * second call will be 0, the async operation completed successfully and
 * the material has been loaded into the appropriate objects.
 * Alternatively, if PENDING, "poll" by calling the function again and
 * keep calling the function while the return is PENDING, until
 * obtaining another return. If for some future call, the return is 0,
 * the download is complete, if some other error, the download failed.
 * <p>For more on PREVIOUS and ASYNC, see the User's Manual.

/** Create a new transport context. This allocates space for an "empty"

 * <code>
 * <pre>
 *   extern VtTransportImpl VtTransportImplHttpsWinINet;

 * <p>Associated with each TransportImpl is specific info. The

 * info it needs. That data could be another object, it could be data
 * in a particular struct, it might be a NULL pointer. Check the
 * documentation for each TransportImpl for a description of the data
 * and its required format.
 * <p>To use this function decide which TransportImpl you want to use,
 * then determine what information that TransportImpl needs and in
 * which format it is presented. Collect the data in the appropriate
 * format then call this function passing in the desired TransportImpl
 * and the required info. The associated info must be cast to Pointer.
 * <p>For example, if the required info is a VtItem, declare a variable
 * to be of type VtItem, fill in the fields, then pass the address of
 * that VtItem cast to Pointer.
 * <p>The input transportCtx is a pointer to a context. It should point
 * to a NULL VtTransportCtx. This function will go to the address given
 * and deposit a created context.
 * <p>If you call Create, you must call Destroy after you are done with
 * the context but before the program exits.

/** The following is the definition of a password manager callback.
 * <p>A manager does more than collect, it can set or change a password
 * as well. It deals only with passwords, not usernames. It is
 * generally used in storage contexts that protect data with
 * password-based encryption, or use an "extra" password.
 * <p>When the toolkit needs a password, it will call whatever password
 * manager function is loaded (wherever it is to be loaded: in a data
 * struct, as an arg, etc.). An application will supply a function that
 * satisfies the definition of the password manager typedef, along with
 * local info for the toolkit to pass back to the manager function when
 * it is called.
 * <p>The toolkit will have possession of the appData (it will be
 * loaded along with the manager function). The toolkit will either
 * copy the data (if an AppDataCopy function is supplied) or copy a
 * reference (if no AppDataCopy is supplied). The appData might
 * contain a window handle to open a password collection window, it
 * might simply contain a buffer with the password. The appData is
 * whatever the password manager function needs to perform the tasks.
 * <p>The toolkit can call the manager to set, change, or collect a
 * password. It will pass a flag indicating what it wants.
 * <p>When a toolkit function needs a password, it will call whatever
 * function it was given, using the appData it has as the appData
 * arg to the manager function. It will also pass a flag indicating it
 * is collecting a password. The toolkit will also pass to the manager
 * function two addresses. The first is the address where the manager
 * function should deposit a pointer to the password. The second
 * address is where the manager will deposit the length of the
 * password. (The manager function also contains args for an old
 * password and length, but when collecting a password, those args are
 * ignored.)
 * <p>Note that the toolkit does not supply a buffer, only an address
 * where the manager deposits a pointer to memory owned by the manager.
 * The toolkit will not alter or free the memory holding the password.
 * <p>When the toolkit is done with the password, it will call the
 * manager again, this time with a purpose indicating it is "releasing"
 * the password. At that point, the manager can free that memory (if
 * it is indeed separate allocated memory) or it may keep the buffer
 * around in case the toolkit asks for the password again.
 * <p>The purpose argument is the toolkit's way of indicating what it
 * wants the password manager to do. This flag will be one of the
 * following.
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_SET
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_CHANGE
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_CHANGE_RETRY
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_COLLECT
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_COLLECT_RETRY
 *    VT_PASSWORD_MGR_PURPOSE_RELEASE
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>When the purpose is SET, the toolkit will be setting up something
 * to hold password info (it may be storing the HMAC of a password in a
 * file, for instance). The password manager's job is to obtain and
 * return the password that the toolkit will set, and which will be used
 * in the future. (If SET, the oldPassword and oldPasswordLen args should
 * be ignored.)
 * <p>When the purpose is CHANGE, the manager's job is to obtain and
 * return the old password and a new one. The toolkit will confirm the
 * old password is correct and set the new one. When the purpose is
 * CHANGE_RETRY, the toolkit had called CHANGE, the manager returned an
 * old and new password, but the old password did not work, so now the
 * toolkit is asking the manager for another old password to try.
 * <p>If the purpose is SET or CHANGE, the new password can be NULL
 * (with 0 length), indicating that the toolkit should no longer use a
 * password. For example with Win32 storage, it is possible to use an
 * "extra" password (beyond the normal protection offerred by
 * CryptProtectData). If an extra password is being used, it is
 * possible to change to no extra password.
 * <p>When the purpose is COLLECT, the toolkit is asking the manager to
 * return the password. When the purpose is COLLECT_RETRY, the toolkit
 * had called COLLECT, the manager returned a password, but that
 * password did not work, so now the toolkit is asking the manager for
 * a new password to try. (If COLLECT or COLLECT_RETRY, the oldPassword
 * and oldPasswordLen args should be ignored.)
 * <p>When the purpose is RELEASE, the toolkit is letting the manager
 * know the toolkit has used the password it collected (any password,
 * old and new for setting or regular collection) and the manager can
 * free any memory or close any windows or do whatever it needs to do
 * to clean up. The password, passwordLen, oldPassword, and
 * oldPasswordLen args will contain the pointers and lengths the
 * manager returned to the toolkit. If RELEASE, the implementation must
 * return 0. The toolkit will call with RELEASE even if there had been
 * no successful SET, COLLECT, etc. call. That is, the toolkit will
 * call the manager to COLLECT, something goes wrong, there is an
 * error, but as part of the cleanup, the toolkit calls RELEASE. It is
 * the password manager's responsibility to know if the RELEASE is
 * necessary and perform operations if it is, and do nothing if not.
 * <p>The COLLECT_RETRY call will come after a COLLECT or another
 * COLLECT_RETRY call.
 * <p>The toolkit can call the password manager to COLLECT more than
 * once, if it needs a password again. However, it will always call
 * with RELEASE before asking to collect again. A manager might collect
 * the password from a user once, then keep it around in case the
 * toolkit requests it again.
 * <p>The return value from this call should be 0 for success, or
 * either VT_ERROR_MEMORY, VT_ERROR_PASSWORD_CALLBACK, or
 * VT_ERROR_INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO when the function could not complete
 * the task. If the error is not memory and the app wants to know more
 * than ERROR_PASSWORD_CALLBACK or INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO (e.g., there
 * was a maximum retry count and the user kept typing in the wrong
 * password and the max was reached), it should set something up in the
 * appData.
 * <p>After calling the password manager, the toolkit will check the
 * return value, if 0, it will continue, if not 0, it will discontinue
 * operations and return the error to the app. So any error number is
 * actually valid. However, most apps will probably find it easier to
 * manage and maintain if the callback returns only the MEMORY,
 * PASSWORD_CALLBACK, or INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO errors, and determine
 * error specifics outside the toolkit.
 *
 * @param libCtx The library context if the password manager can use it
 * (for example, to allocate and free memory).

/** The following is the definition of a username-password collector
 * callback. The username and password are generally associated with an
 * identity. The toolkit will ask the collector to return a username
 * and password associated with a given identity.
 * <p>The collector cannot manage usernames and passwords, it can only
 * collect them and pass them on to the operation that needs them. It
 * will be used in cases where a username and an associated password
 * are required to perform some kind of operation, generally in
 * username/password based authentications.
 * <p>See the password manager can do more with passwords.
 * <p>When the toolkit needs a username and password, it will call 
 * whatever username-password collector function is loaded. An
 * application will supply a function that satisfies the definition of
 * the username-password collector typedef, along with the local info
 * for the toolkit to pass back to the collector function when it is
 * called.
 * <p>The toolkit will have possession of the appData (it will be
 * loaded along with the manager function). The toolkit will either
 * copy the data (if an AppDataCopy function is supplied) or copy a
 * reference (if no AppDataCopy is supplied). The appData might
 * contain a window handle to open a username-password collection
 * window, it might simply contain buffers with the username and
 * password. The appData is whatever the username-password collector
 * function needs to perform the tasks.
 * <p>The toolkit can call the username-password collector to collect
 * or release a username-password combination. It will pass a flag
 * indicating what it wants.
 * <p>When a toolkit function needs a username and password, it will
 * call whatever function it was given, using the appData it has as
 * the appData arg to the collector function. It will also pass a flag
 * indicating it is collecting a password. The toolkit will also pass
 * to the collector function four addresses. The first address is where
 * the collector function should deposit a pointer to the username. The
 * second address is where the collector function should deposit the
 * length of the username. The third pointer is the address where the
 * collector function will deposit the pointer to the password. The
 * fourth address is where the collector function will deposit length
 * of the password.
 * <p>Note that the toolkit does not supply buffers, only addresses
 * where the collector function deposits a pointer to memory owned by the 
 * collector function itself. The toolkit will not alter or free the
 * memory holding the password.
 * <p>When the toolkit is done with the username and password, it will
 * call the collector function again, this time with a purpose
 * indicating it is "releasing" the username and password. At that
 * point, the collector can free that memory (if it is indeed separate
 * allocated memory) or it may keep the buffers around in case the
 * toolkit asks for the username and password again.
 * <p>The purpose argument is the toolkit's way of indicating what it
 * wants the password collector to do. This flag will be one of the
 * following.
 * <pre>
 * <code>    
 *    VT_USER_PASS_COLLECTOR_PURPOSE_COLLECT
 *    VT_USER_PASS_COLLECTOR_PURPOSE_COLLECT_RETRY
 *    VT_USER_PASS_COLLECTOR_PURPOSE_RELEASE
 * </code>
 * </pre> 
 * <p>When the purpose is COLLECT, the toolkit is asking the collector to
 * return the username and the associated password for a given identity.
 * <p>When the purpose is COLLECT_RETRY, the toolkit had called
 * COLLECT, the collector returned a username and password, but that
 * combination did not work, so now the toolkit is asking the collector
 * to try again. This can be helpful to keep track of how many times
 * the username-password has been requested and not allow requests
 * after certain number of tries.
 * <p>When the purpose is RELEASE, the toolkit is letting the collector 
 * function know that toolkit has used the username and password it 
 * collected and the collector can free any memory or close any windows
 * or do whatever it needs to do to clean up. The username,
 * usernameLen, password, and passwordLen args will contain the pointers
 * and lengths the collector returned to the toolkit. If RELEASE, the
 * implementation must return 0. The toolkit will call with RELEASE even
 * if there had been no successful COLLECT. That is, the toolkit might
 * call the collector to COLLECT, but something goes wrong, there is an
 * error, and as part of the cleanup, the toolkit calls RELEASE. It is
 * the password collector's responsibility to know if the RELEASE is
 * necessary and perform operations if it is, or do nothing if not.
 * <p>The COLLECT_RETRY call will come after a COLLECT or another
 * COLLECT_RETRY call.
 * <p>The toolkit can call the username-password collector to COLLECT
 * more than once, if it needs a username and password again. However,
 * it will always call with RELEASE before asking to collect again. A
 * username-password collector might collect the username and password
 * from a user once, then keep it around in case the toolkit requests
 * it again.
 * <p>The return value from this call should be 0 for success, or either 
 * VT_ERROR_MEMORY, VT_ERROR_PASSWORD_CALLBACK, or 
 * VT_ERROR_INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO when the function could not complete
 * the task. If the error is not memory and the app wants to know more
 * than ERROR_PASSWORD_CALLBACK or INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO (e.g., there
 * was a maximum retry count and the user kept typing in the wrong
 * password and the max was reached), it should set something up in the
 * appData.
 * <p>After calling the username-password collector, the toolkit will
 * check the return value, if 0, it will continue, if not 0, it will
 * discontinue operations and return the error to the app. So any error
 * number is actually valid. However, most apps will probably find it
 * easier to manage and maintain if the callback returns only the
 * MEMORY, PASSWORD_CALLBACK, or INVALID_CALLBACK_INFO errors, and
 * determine error specifics outside the toolkit.
 *
 * @param libCtx The library context if the password collector can use it
 * (for example, to allocate and free memory).
 * @param appData The application-supplied local information passed
 * to the toolkit when the collector was originally loaded, now being
 * passed back to the collector function.

 * standard (along with the people wo wrote and disseminate it) that

 * advance to resolve an intentional ambiguity in the standard.
 * <p>Fortunately, PKCS #7 specifies that all block ciphers in modes

 * be UTF-8 string (an ASCII string is already a UTF-8 string).
 * <p>Or it is used to get the email and validity info out of the
 * identity object.
 * <p>The associated info is a VtEmailValidityInfo struct.
 * <p>When setting, build the VtEmailValidityInfo struct with the email
 * address, an identity time, a base time, and a validity period (in
 * seconds). Then pass the address of that struct as the associatedInfo.
 * <p>When getting, pass in the address of a pointer as the getInfo,
 * the Get function will deposit a VtEmailValidityInfo pointer at the
 * address.
 * <p>The time in an encoded identity (the actual public key of IBE) is
 * actually a "notBefore" time. For example, an identity based on the
 * email address name@sample.com can be name@sample.com for the week of
 * Oct. 20, 2003. Then name@sample.com for the week of April 11, 2005
 * is a different identity. There will be different IBE private keys
 * associated with each of those two identities, even though they use
 * the same email address.
 * <p>Generally, an app will use a validity period, so that identities
 * don't change every second. For instance, name@sample.com at 3:00 GMT
 * Oct. 22, 2003, and name@sample.com at 17:30 GMT Oct. 25, 2003, can
 * use the same "notBefore" time (e.g. 0:00 GMT, Oct. 20, 2003). In
 * other words, the time associated with an identity is actually a
 * week, rather than a particular second. That allows a user to
 * download one private key every week, rather than one private key
 * every email message.
 * <p>Hence, the time in the encoded identity can be different from the
 * time given in the Param's associated info.
 * <p>With this RecipientInfoParam, the validity period is
 * application-defined. The associated info contains (in addition to
 * the expected fields of email address and time) a field for a base
 * time and another field for validity period. The toolkit will
 * determine a notBefore time based on those values.
 * <p>The validity period is given in number of seconds. For example, a
 * validity period of one hour is 3600 seconds.
 * <p>When you Get this Param out of an object before the identity is
 * encoded, the email time will be the same time originally input. When
 * you Get this param out of an object after the identity is encoded,
 * the email time will be the notBefore time. That is, the input time
 * is converted by the encoder into a notBefore time. If there is a
 * notBefore time available, that is the time that will be returned.

/** When you have an identity, but not the IBE private key, signing

 * objects, the routine will set the objects with the IBE private key,
 * the signing private key and the cert.
 * <p>The keys and cert might be in storage (represented by the storage
 * provider). If so, the function will return those keys and cert.
 * <p>If the function cannot find the keys and cert in storage, it will
 * generate a new DSA key pair, build a cert request, and download the
 * IBE private key and the cert from the district/key server using the
 * given transport provider. It is the responsibility of the storage
 * provider or the transport provider along with the district/key server
 * to authenticate the identity. When generating a new key pair, the
 * function will use the parameter set in the district parameter
 * extensions, if the district parameters contain the "dsa-parameters"
 * extension. If the district does not have a parameter set, the
 * function will generate new system parameters.
 * <p>If the function downloads the key from the server, and if a
 * storage context is available, it will call on that storage ctx to
 * store the newly created private key, the returned cert, and the
 * returned IBE private key. If the storage context object contains
 * more than one provider, the function will store each element in the
 * first provider that can store it.
 * <p>If a NULL transport context is given, and if there is no
 * transport context in the libCtx, this function will look only in
 * storage. If the elements are not in storage, the function will not
 * generate new values and download, but will return
 * VT_ERROR_NO_TRANSPORT_CTX error.
 * <p>If a NULL storage context is given, and if there is no storage
 * context in the libCtx, this function will generate a new key pair
 * and download the values. Nothing, of course, will be stored.
 * <p>It is also possible to instruct this function to look only in
 * storage, to never try to download, by setting the input arg flag to
 * the appropriate value.
 * <p>If the flag arg is 0 (VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_STORAGE_AND_DOWNLOAD),
 * the function will execute the default behavior (look in storage and
 * if not there, download. Otherwise, the flag arg should be the OR of
 * all the VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_ values which define non-default
 * behavior. Currently, there are only three possible non-default
 * values:
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_STORAGE_ONLY
 *     VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_DOWNLOAD_ONLY
 *     VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_DO_NOT_STORE
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>If you set the flag to contain the bit for STORAGE_ONLY, the
 * function will try to find the values in storage, but if they are not
 * there, it will not generate a new key pair and download.
 * <p>If you set the flag to contain the bit for DOWNLOAD_ONLY, the
 * function will not search the storage providers, but will generate a
 * new signing key pair and cert request, then download the values and
 * store them (unless the DO_NOT_STORE bit is set).
 * <p>If you set the flag to contain the bit for DO_NOT_STORE, the
 * function will not store any element it downloads.
 * <p>If you want to use your own system parameters (you don't want
 * this function to generate new params, for example), you should call
 * this function with the VT_OBTAIN_KEYS_FLAG_STORAGE_ONLY set in the
 * flag argument. If the function succeeds, you're done. If not use
 * your own system params to generate a DSA key pair, then build a cert
 * request and call VtDownloadIBEPrivateKeyAndCert.
 * <p>If the caller passes a NULL object for the ibe private key,
 * signing key, or cert, the function will not obtain (nor store) those
 * values. For example, if you pass a NULL ibePriKey, and a non-NULL
 * signingKey and cert, the function will obtain only the signing key
 * and cert. If the function had to generate a new DSA key pair and
 * download the cert, it will store only the private key and cert, not
 * an IBE private key that might have been downloaded while the cert
 * was downloaded.
 * <p>NOTE!!! If this function finds in storage a signing private key but
 * no cert, or a cert but no signing private key, it will generate a
 * new pair and download a new cert. It will store the new key and
 * cert, which will likely overwrite the old one (whichever of the two
 * was in storage). If one of the two elements is missing and if no
 * transport ctx is provided (or found in the libCtx), the function will
 * not return the element that is in storage.
 * <p>VT_ERROR_ASYNC_DOWNLOAD: This function may return the
 * "asynchronous download" error. This error code indicates that the
 * information could not be downloaded because further caller
 * operations are required. These operations are defined by the
 * transport context. In other words, the function could not download
 * the data but will be able to download it after the caller performs
 * some other operations defined by the transport provider. If this
 * function returns ASYNC_DOWNLOAD, execute the special transport
 * operations, then call this routine again.
 *
 * @param identity The identity for which the IBE private key, signing
 * private key, and cert are requested.
 * @param random A random object to use if generating a new key pair.
 * @param flag If 0, the function will perform default behavior.
