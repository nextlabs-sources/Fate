      <p align="justify" class="style2">Whenever you trigger an active policy, the <strong> <strong>Enterprise Data Protection Enforcer</strong></strong> running on this PC may display a notification. Policies may be triggered by an attempt to perform a prohibited action, such as trying to open some file (or other information resource) you do not have permission to use or performing some unauthorized action on a resource, such as printing it, copying & pasting its content, or attaching it to an e-mail. They may also be triggered by an <em>allowed</em> action, simply  to remind you about some data resource's sensitive content, or to automate some required workflow, such as  encrypting all copies of a file.</p> 
      <p align="justify" class="style2">Policy enforcement notifications take two forms:  either balloon messages in the bottom right corner of the screen, or standard Windows error messages in the center of the screen. At times, both may display  together.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2"> If you like, you can turn the notification feature off, by  right-clicking on the Data Protection icon in your system tray and selecting <strong>Display Notifications</strong> to uncheck it. Bear in mind that when the display is turned off all active policies will still be enforced; you just won't  see any balloon messages at the bottom of your screen. (The standard Windows error messages, in the center of the screen, will still display.) To turn the feature back on, click <strong>Display Notifications</strong>. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">You may see notifications of policy enforcement when you are prevented from doing some action, and also even when your action is not blocked. This latter case is called <em>On Allow Enforcements</em>. If these are so frequent that they become annoying, you can disable them by unchecking the <strong>Display Notifications On Allowed</strong> item in the list, after which you will see only On Deny notifications. Here too, click the item again to re-enable the feature. </p>
