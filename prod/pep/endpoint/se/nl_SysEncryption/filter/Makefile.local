# Variables
#

# The name of the driver
DRIVER_NAME=nl_SysEncryption

# The type of this kernel module
#   - sys: this is a driver
#   - lib: this is a kernel library
DRIVER_TYPE=sys

# The inf file for this driver
# If this is a kernel library, this variable is not necessary
INF_FILE=nlse.inf

# Resource file for this driver
# If this is a kernel library, this variable is not necessary
RC_FILE=nlse.rc

# CoInstaller DLL used by WDF
# If this driver is not a WDF driver, we don't need this
COINSTALLER_FILE=yes

# Should compiler create CAT file?
# If this is a kernel library, this variable is not necessary
# The INF file decide whether there is CAT files. Normally, PNP driver needs to have CAT files
CAT_FILE=yes

# Version strings
VERSION_STR=6.5.0.0

# The build number
# If user don't define this build number, build system will use current date/time automatically
VERSION_BUILD=9999

# Product Names
VERSION_PRODUCT=NextLabs Common Library

# Default Target
# If user input: "make --file=Makefile.local", then compile_free will be used.
# This will compile objfre_wxp_x86 and objfre_win7_amd64
# If user use other target, for example, "make --file=Makefile.local compile_checked", then compile_free will be overwritten by compile_checked.
# And objchk_wxp_x86 and objchk_win7_amd64 will be compiled
TARGETS_DRIVER=compile_free
