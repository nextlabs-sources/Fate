NOTE:

You have to copy in podofo, zlib, freetype, resattrmgr, and resattrlib
dlls yourself.  New MS conventions mean that C++ code can not be mixed
debug and release, so if you build this code debug you must use podofo
debug code and if you build release you must use release.  This also
holds for resattrlib and resattrmgr.  zlib and freetype don't have
this restriction.
